I chose the licensing I did because it after reading about it on the wikipedia page it seemed to be the best one for this particular project. It gives a complete copy right grant to my project, as well as a patent grant. It also allows other users to see my project and make changes to their own version and request to submit those changes to the origin code. For these reasons I see this licesning fit for my repository. 

The code of conduct I chose most suited the rules and guidelines I wished to have for my repository. The code of conduct that I picked outlines rules for acting empathatically, fairly, and respectfully. It also goes over the enforcement of the rules set out and those in charge of enforcing. It gives a general idea of what steps of punishment will be taken and how to avoid being punished all together by following the rules. It goes over different types of bans and suspensions then finally the attributions of where the code of conduct file originally came from.
